                    India’s maternal mortality rate stands at approximately 97 per 1,000 live births, with countless cases of 
                    severe infections and life-threatening diseases. These not only endanger mothers but also impact their 
                    children and families. Many of these health risks stem from inadequate sanitation and hygiene post birth. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I am being honest, this is not something I was always aware about or something I bothered looking into. However, this topic was brought up
                    at a dinner in our house in early 2023. You see, my parents run a pharmaceutical distribution company where they primarily supply different medical products to hospitals.
                    They have been trying to expand the business into manufacturing. They were discussing this opportunity of producing handwoven maternity pads and were discussing how they could do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did not know much about maternity pads or why they were used but I was curious. So I started doing some research and I came across the awful statistics related to post birth
                    infections and diseases and how they were linked to poor sanitation and hygiene.
                    Mass produced maternity pads are often very coarse, filled with chemicals and plastics and can cause irritation and rashes. On the contrary, handwoven maternity pads are made 
                    from natural fibers like cotton and are much softer and more breathable. They are also biodegradable and environmentally friendly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it is hard to mass produced them because the process it is a manual process. There are some machines available that help cut the cotton into specific pieces but nothing as such that can do end to end manufacturing.
                    I was curious so I grabbed some gauge and cotton fabric and started experimenting with different designs with the help of youtube. My focus was on creating comfortable 
                    shape that would fit well and not cause any irritation. I also wanted to make sure that the pads were absorbent enough to handle the post birth discharge. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Initially it was my mom and I who were making these, packing them up in batches and supplying them to one of the biggest hospitals in Delhi. 
                    They really liked the product and we started getting more and more orders. Something that mom and I just could not do ourselves. So I created a tutorial
                    video and helped train some new employees to assist with the production. These were mostly young females from lower socio economic areas for whom often this was their first job. 
                    This segment of the business now has a become a self sufficient unit that provides employment for these young females and serves an actual need for new mothers.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    I feel very proud and grateful that I played a significant part in generating this economic opportunity for these young women. I am also very happy with the business exposure I got from solving this problem.
                    I had a front row seat in observing how a small business can enter new markets. I was able to go from an idea to a prototype I created for my curosity to ultimately a product that people want to buy.
                    The lessons I learnt in this journey are invaluable and I am sure they will help me in my future endeavours.
